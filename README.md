# Structura: DSA Simulator

Structura is a Python-based Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) simulator designed to help students visualize and understand fundamental DSA concepts through interactive graphical simulations.

This project was developed as a final requirement for the Data Structures and Algorithms course.

## 🖥️ System Overview

The application uses a centralized controller to manage navigation between different frames and modules.

- `main.py` – Main application controller  
- Frame-based navigation system  
- Each DSA topic is implemented as a separate module  
- Designed following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Pillow (Image Processing)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
